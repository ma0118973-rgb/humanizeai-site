// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Muse AI (Meta) — availability data for the Muse AI Hub (Tool #54).
//
// Data amanat (update protocol):
// - A country is marked "available" ONLY when Meta's own official pages say
//   so. Last full check: 10 October 2026 (Meta launch post 8 Sep 2026 on
//   about.fb.com + Meta's Muse for Small Business announcement 29 Sep 2026:
//   "a personal AI agent available in the US and Canada").
// - Countries that third-party sites talk about but Meta has NOT confirmed
//   are marked "unverified" — never presented as available.
// - Everything else is "notyet": Meta has announced no launch date.
// When Meta announces a new country, move its code into VERIFIED_AVAILABLE
// and bump CHECKED_DATE + the checked strings in the workspace component.
